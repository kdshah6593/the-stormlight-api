## Home Page
1. Page will have header and subheader
2. Then a component that includes a search bar to test out the api
3. A display in that same component that displays the JSON response.


## About page
1. Incorporate Links


## Documentation page

2. What options are available
3. what characteristics are available
4. Create a sidebar with links to each of the sections above and

1. Fix Margin Spacing of Documentation Headers
2. Work on Figuring out the tab anchoring to different headers so it title is displayed, not just the text


3. When the initial home page renders, it should automatically call a search result from API

4. Add a Menu to the Header
- If not logged in, it will show Login and Sign Up Options
- If logged in, it will show Add Data, Edit Data, Logout Options for users and verified users
- If logged in and admin, will also show a dashboard page

5. Then Need to Create:
